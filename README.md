### Project Overview

 Bank Market Analysis
There has been a revenue decline for the Portuguese bank and they would like to know what actions to take. After investigation, we found out that the root cause is that their clients are not depositing as frequently as before. Knowing that term deposits allow banks to hold onto a deposit for a specific amount of time, so banks can invest in higher gain financial products to make a profit. In addition, banks also hold better chance to persuade term deposit clients into buying other products such as funds or insurance to further increase their revenues. As a result, the Portuguese bank would like to identify existing clients that have higher chance to subscribe for a term deposit and focus marketing effort on such clients. In this code along we are doing the data analysis using the pandas.

Understanding the dataset
Data Set Information

The data is related to direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, in order to access if the product (bank term deposit) would be ('yes') or not ('no') subscribed. There are four datasets: bank-additional-full.csv with all examples (41188) and 20 inputs, ordered by date (from May 2008 to November 2010), very close to the data analyzed in [Moro et al., 2014] bank-additional.csv with 10% of the examples (4119), randomly selected from 1), and 20 inputs. bank-full.csv with all examples and 17 inputs, ordered by date (older version of this dataset with fewer inputs). bank.csv with 10% of the examples and 17 inputs, randomly selected from 3 (older version of this dataset with fewer inputs). The smallest datasets are provided to test more computationally demanding machine learning algorithms Goal:- The classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe (yes/no) a term deposit (variable y).
